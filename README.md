# OutrunSharp
A WIP C# rewrite of [outrun](https://github.com/Mtbcooler/outrun), the server software powering Sonic Runners Revival.

OutrunSharp is a Sonic Runners custom server powered by ASP.NET, based off of research done by fluofoxxo and FairPlay137.

## What you need to get this server working
* Visual Studio 2019 or better (Community version will work)
* .NET 5.0 SDK
* ASP.NET build support
* A MySQL instance

## How to build
TBD
